# Computer_Science_Engineer_Study_Plan
Am a android developer in good software developed firm. I was always wondered how programs are run, functions are working and how its organized for specific OS etc... So i started to learn about programming basics where i found [this awesome]( https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university ) repository. 
Software development and software engineering both are two different poles in software world. AS a Developer i never wants to know about algorithms, data structures, even about IDE. Those where the components are build by some developers combined with engineers i just to know how to write a program create a class, implement some intefaces, arrays(add, delete, clear).. etc
Software engineering is about how the function add reacts in arrays when we input some data in the method, how data is stored in memory efficiently.

# Flash Card
As a first step of my study plan i created my own flash card app. Design not so looks elegant but it works fine. Users can add their study card and retrive it as their wish random question selection to test ourselves.  
[This app]( https://github.com/ronobebe/Flash_Card ) is my own pareparation works completely in ofline using SQlite DataBase. SO if any one need data please retrive you db and restore it anyWhere.

# DataStructures
So for Now i created a [Simple project]( https://github.com/ronobebe/DataStructures )t to practise my self. In that i created copy of each datastructure [mentioned here.]( https://github.com/ronobebe/ComputerEngineerStudyPlan#arrays )
