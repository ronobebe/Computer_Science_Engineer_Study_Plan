# Computer_Science_Engineer_Study_Plan
Am a android developer in good software developed firm. I was always wondered how programs are run, functions are working and how its organized for specific OS etc... So i started to learn about programming basics where i found [this awesome]( https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards ) repository. 
Software development and software engineering both are two different poles in software world. AS a Developer i never wants to know about algorithms, data structures, even about IDE. Those where the components are build by some developers combined with engineers i just to know how to write a program create a class, implement some intefaces, arrays(add, delete, clear).. etc
Software engineering is about how the function add reacts in arrays when we input some data in the method, how data is stored in memory efficiently.
